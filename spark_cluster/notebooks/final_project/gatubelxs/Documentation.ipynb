    "## Introduction and Problem Definition \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze real-time data from an e-commerce web application. Using Apache Kafka, user session data will be consumed in real time, then processed and stored in Parquet files by Apache Spark. The resulting dataset will be used to train a Machine Learning model that can predict user behavior within the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data captured from the application includes real-time information about each user session, such as the pages visited, seen products, user interactions within the diferent elements in the page, such as scroll, zoom, hover and the clicks performed. The goal of this project is to leverage this information to predict whether a user is likely to make a purchase in future sessions."

    "## System Architecture\n",
    "The architecture of this project consists of three real-time producers, each writing data to a different Kafka topic. Each producer generates a distinct type of data: the first focuses solely on the page and product the user is viewing, the second captures all click events within the session, and the third generates data related to other user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data consumption, three Kafka consumers are used, each reading from its respective topic. The data is processed using a PySpark session with structured streaming. Initially, the JSON data is parsed and transformed into columns, and then another streaming pipeline writes the data into Parquet files, effectively creating a small data lake.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable machine learning, a separate Spark session reads the Parquet files. The data is grouped by session, computing aggregations such as the total number of clicks and other user interactions. These aggregated features are used to train a model. A DecisionTreeClassifier from PySpark’s MLlib was chosen, using the btn_buy variable as the label, which indicates whether the user clicked the “buy” button during that session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the prediction results were visualized in a Power BI dashboard to make the insights more accessible and easier to interpret.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Technologies Used\n",
    "- Apache Kafka\n",
    "Kafka was used as the real-time messaging system to decouple the data producers from consumers. It provides high throughput, scalability, and durability, making it ideal for real-time event streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- PySpark (Apache Spark with Python API)\n",
    "PySpark was used for both real-time and batch data processing. Spark Structured Streaming handled streaming data from Kafka, while batch jobs were used for feature engineering and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parquet\n",
    "Parquet, a columnar storage format, was chosen for its performance benefits in analytical workloads. It supports efficient compression and encoding, which reduces storage size and speeds up query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Power BI\n",
    "Power BI was used for creating interactive dashboards to visualize the predictions and insights generated by the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Three separate Kafka producers and topics were used to isolate the types of data: page views, click events, and other user interactions. This separation improves modularity, scalability, and makes it easier to track issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Storing data in Parquet format within a data lake enabled historical data analysis and reuse for training ML models without re-ingesting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data was aggregated at the session level to capture meaningful behavioral patterns. This allowed the machine learning model to learn from combined features such as total clicks, number of interactions, and product views per session.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A DecisionTreeClassifier was chosen for its interpretability and fast training time, which is suitable for iterative development and evaluation.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully implemented a real-time data processing pipeline for an e-commerce web application using Apache Kafka, PySpark, and Parquet. User session data—such as page views, click events, and interactions—was collected and processed to create a rich dataset for training a DecisionTreeClassifier aimed at predicting the likelihood of a user making a purchase. The pipeline combined real-time streaming and batch processing, enabling both immediate insights and long-term analysis. Aggregating data at the session level improved model performance by providing contextual behavioral features. The results were visualized using Power BI, offering accessible and actionable insights. Key learnings include the effectiveness of integrating streaming technologies with machine learning, the benefits of session-based feature engineering, and the practicality of using interpretable models like decision trees to support early-stage predictive analytics."
